        <h1>Intentions</h1>
        <p>I have always had a distinct connection with animals. Among dogs, cats, birds, and even rodents, as I have picked up a few opossums in my time.</p>
        <p>This appreciation of wildlife and animals led me to take up animal sitting in my free time. Although it is difficult to get my hands on sometimes, work is work.</p>
        <p>I hope to use this website to get myself a few more jobs here and there, and also use it to try and get myself started in my possible future in software or web development. Although I am sure this will be a janky first edition, it is an edition regardless.</p>

        <h1>Interests</h1>

        <p>I, like most other people, have many interests. Those without more than a few will always confuse me, but everyone experiences a different life in the first place.</p>
        <p>I have always found myself to be very competitive, even when I should not have been. Thus, I began sports at a young age to try and curb my extra energy and bring some regiment to my life.</p>
